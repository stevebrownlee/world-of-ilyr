            Follow Iris Evershade who, after years of struggle in the Arbory of Elm, discovers her abilities to work with a suppressed Harmony that, at one point, threatened the entire world of I'lyr. At a time when the five Arbories work in harmony to maintain peace and order, a massive and mysterious burst of dissonant energy throws everything into chaos.
          </p>
          <p class="text-xl text-slate-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
            A journey into the Northern Wilds and then to ancient, abandoned settlements has Iris discovering just how much knowledge the Elders have suppressed for centuries. She must rediscover that knowledge, and work with her friends to suppress an ancient corruption known as the Whisper.

        Synopsis
      </h2>
      <div class="prose prose-lg prose-invert max-w-none text-xl">
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          In the mystical world of I'lyr, harmony is everything. The great Arbories—schools of magical practice—teach students to channel the power of trees through music, breathing and words. Elm for connection and flexibility, Oak for endurance and protection, Birch for renewal and clarity, Ash for transformation and wisdom, Fir for resilience and focus. Five traditions that have shaped civilization for generations.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          But there was once a sixth. It was suppressed for reasons lost to official history, its practitioners scattered, its knowledge forbidden.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Iris Evershade arrives at the Arbory of Elm as a promising student, eager to master the gentle arts of emotional harmony. But her attempts to work with conventional techniques yield little results. Her intelligence and knowledge of theory is unchallenged, but she struggles to evoke the simplest of harmonies.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          As Iris awakens her true abilities, The Corrupted Whisper, an ancient force of entropy and despair, begins to spread through the harmonic traditions. It feeds on the very connections that make harmony possible, turning practitioners against each other and corrupting even the most respected Elders.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
          To save her world, Iris must embrace the forbidden knowledge, but in doing so, she risks not only her own sanity but the very foundations of everything she's been taught to believe. With the help of loyal friends and unlikely allies, Iris must learn to walk the dangerous line between order and chaos, tradition and innovation, to contain a corruption that threatens to consume everything she holds dear.
