            My name is Steve Brownlee, and welcome to the world of I'lyr.

          <p class="text-xl text-slate-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
            The Secret Harmony and its companion short stories represent years
            of world-building, character development, and exploration of themes
            around tradition, innovation, and the power of music and nature to
            shape our understanding of reality. I grew up loving nature,
            spending every opportunity to be in the forests around my childhood
            home. Iris Evershade is deeply inspired by my oldest daughter's
            journey through childhood into adulthood.

              The World of I'lyr
            </h3>
            <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed text-lg">
              I'lyr is a world where magic flows through music, where trees hold
              ancient wisdom, and where the boundaries between the physical and
              spiritual realms can be crossed by those brave enough to walk the
              threshold paths. It's a place where institutional knowledge
              clashes with folk wisdom, where young people must choose between
              safety and truth, and where the power of connection can overcome
              even the darkest corruptions.

        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Fantasy literature has always been about more than escapism to me.
          It's about exploring the deepest questions of human experience through
          the lens of the impossible. In the world of I'lyr, I've tried to
          create a magic system that reflects the complexity of real-world
          knowledge systems: how there are multiples facets and perspectives of
          our world, how institutions preserve and control information, how folk
          wisdom survives alongside formal education, and how individuals must
          sometimes break rules to serve the greater good.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The harmonic traditions of I'lyr are inspired by the way music,
          nature, and human emotion interweave in our own world. Each of the
          Arbories represents a different approach to understanding and working
          with these forces, but like any institutional system, they can become
          rigid and exclusionary.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
          Through Iris Evershade's journey and the stories of those who came
          before her, I hope to explore themes of personal growth, institutional
          reform, environmental harmony, and the courage required to challenge
          systems that no longer serve their original purpose. These are stories
          about finding your voice, building community, and the transformative
          power of embracing both tradition and innovation.

            World-Building
          </h3>
          <p class="text-slate-300">
            The world of I'lyr began with a simple question: what if magic
            worked through music and trees? From there, I developed the six
            harmonic traditions, each with their own philosophy, techniques, and
            cultural practices.

            Magic System
          </h3>
          <p class="text-slate-300">
            The harmonic magic system is based on real musical principles and
            the way different trees have been associated with various qualities
            throughout human history. Each tradition has its own "syllabery" and
            techniques.

            Institutional Politics
          </h3>
          <p class="text-slate-300">
            The Arbories represent how educational institutions can both
            preserve valuable knowledge and become obstacles to innovation.
            Their politics reflect real-world academic and religious
            hierarchies.

            Folk Traditions
          </h3>
          <p class="text-slate-300">
            The Wild Harmonies and guardian spirit beliefs represent indigenous
            knowledge systems that exist alongside formal education, often
            preserving wisdom that institutions have forgotten or suppressed.

          The world of I'lyr has many more stories to tell. I'm currently
          working on additional short stories that explore different regions,
          time periods, and aspects of harmonic magic. There are also plans for
          more novels that will explore the ancient times where Harmony was
          discovered and how it became fractured.

        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
          I'm also developing a companion guide to the world of I'lyr, complete
          with maps, detailed explanations of the harmonic traditions, character
          genealogies, and historical timelines. This will be a resource for
          readers who want to dive deeper into the world's rich mythology and
          complex political landscape.
